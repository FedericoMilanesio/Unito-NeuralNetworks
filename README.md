# Tutorial Notebooks for Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks used for tutoring students in the "Neural Networks" and "Deep Learning" courses during the academic year 2023/2024. The tutorials cover various topics related to the usage of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.

### Contents
The repository includes the following notebooks:

*Lesson 0* - Introduction to Python: This notebook provides an overview of Python

*Lesson 1* - Pytorch: This notebooks expalins the features of Torch, including its basic operations, tensor manipulation and autograd

*Lesson 2* - Building Neural Networks: This notebook covers PyTorch's torch.nn module, with topics such as defining network architectures, implementing forward and backward passes, and optimizing models with different optimization algorithms

*Lesson 3* - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): We dive into the world of CNNs with PyTorch. This notebook demonstrates how to create CNN architectures for image classification tasks.

### Usage
You can either run these notebooks on Google Colab or download them to your local machine and execute them using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. To run them locally, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies (PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.).

### Feedback and Contributions
We welcome any feedback or contributions to improve these tutorials. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request with your suggestions, corrections, or additional content.

### Authors
The tutorials were created by Federico Milanesio and Davide Pirovano at UniTO, both PhD candidates currently working in neural networks and deep learning.
